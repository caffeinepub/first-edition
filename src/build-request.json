      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Story text is automatically saved to localStorage every 10 seconds when user is actively typing",
        "Autosave timer resets when user types, preventing premature saves during active typing",
        "Autosave functionality works independently of the manual save button",
        "User can continue typing without interruption during autosave operations",
        "Autosaved data persists across page refreshes and browser sessions"

          "msg-latest"

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "User sees a subtle indicator (e.g., 'Saved' text or icon) when autosave completes",
        "Feedback appears briefly and does not obstruct the writing interface",
        "Feedback is clear enough for grade 4 students to understand"

  "constraints": [
    "Autosave must not interfere with manual save operations",
    "Autosave must not cause textarea flickering or performance issues",
    "ProjectContext's existing localStorage save methods should be reused"

  "nonGoals": [
    "Implementing backend-based autosave (local storage only)",
    "Autosaving character data or selected images (story text only)",
    "Modifying the 2000-word limit or word count tracker"
