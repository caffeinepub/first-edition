# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add Google research functionality to the writing interface and fix the production 9-word limit bug.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a Google research area component to the WritingPage where students can search Google directly
- Integrate the research area into the existing sidebar layout alongside dictionary and thesaurus tools
- Investigate and resolve the production bug that limits story writing to 9 words instead of 2000 words
- Ensure the word count display and limit enforcement work correctly in production

**User-visible outcome:** Students can research topics using Google without leaving the writing page, and can write stories up to the full 2000-word limit without being blocked after 9 words.
