# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Implement autosave functionality to automatically save story text every 10 seconds while typing.

**Planned changes:**
- Add automatic saving of story text to localStorage every 10 seconds during active typing
- Include visual feedback (indicator or toast notification) to show when autosave completes
- Ensure autosave does not interfere with manual save operations or cause performance issues

**User-visible outcome:** Students can type their stories without worrying about losing work, as their text automatically saves every 10 seconds with a brief "Saved" indicator appearing to confirm the save.
