# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Limit the main writing textarea to a maximum of 2000 words with real-time enforcement and display.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a 2000-word maximum limit to the WritingPage textarea that prevents further input when reached
- Update the word count display format to show "X / 2000" instead of just the current count
- Block typing and pasting when the 2000-word limit is reached

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see their word count displayed as a fraction (e.g., "1543 / 2000") and will be prevented from exceeding 2000 words in their story text.
